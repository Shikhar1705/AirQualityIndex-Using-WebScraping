# AirQualityIndex-Using-WebScraping
This Project involved Processes Like getting online data using web scraping and making a reusable function to get the live Air Quality data from the weather page, then converting that data into clean data to make analysis based on that and using multiple regression algorithms like:
1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Random Forest Regressor
5. XGBoost Regressor
6. Decision Tree Regressor
To predict if we AQI if we are given the below parameters:

you	Average annual temperature

TM	Average annual maximum temperature

tm	Average annual minimum temperature

PP	Total annual precipitation of rain and/or melted snow (mm)

V	Average annual wind speed (Km/h)

RA	Total days with rain during the year


In this Project, I'm analysing Bangalore city Data to predict AQI continuous Value
I have also covered process to convert the model into pickle file to use it for prediction on a website
